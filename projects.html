        <h2>Sumobot</h2>
        <p>During my senior year at Oregon State University, I worked on my capstone project which was to create a Sumobot. The 4-person team was tasked with creating
            a robot that could fight in a mega sumobot competion. I filed the role of mechnical lead and coding lead. The design we created focused on using interesting shapes 
            and to be easily modified. The design had a metal frame with a 3D printed top and mutliple 3D printed armors. An arduino was used to control the motors and get data from
            the sensors used. The speed and direction of the motors were based off of readings from the sensors.

        <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
        <p>
            Working with <a href="https://aprovecho.org/">Aprovecho Research Center</a>, I created a Jupyter Notebook Interface for Wood Stove Emissions Analysis to effectively create safer traditional wood stove designs mostly found in third world countries. 
            This notebook used code from Aprovecho and added visuals and other functionalty to create a useful user interface. This makes for easier data analysis, which allows for design changes to be more efficient.

        <h2>Masters Project</h2>
        <p>
            Using a UR5e arm, I created a system that will measure the diameter of the branch it is placed in front of. The majors 
            steps of this system are 
            <ol>
                <li>Get Parallel to the branch </li>
                <li>Perform Optical Flow</li>
                <li>Make Contact with the branch</li>
                <li>Using the Optical Flow Mask and Known Distance of the Branch, Determine the Diameter </li>
            </ol>
            This system was coded in python and uses the Robotic Operating System (ROS2). The end effecor was designed in SolidWorks
            and 3D printed. It uses 2 low-cost time-of-flight (TOF) sensors, a load cell, an RGB camera, and an arduino. This system 
            is used to measure trees in an orchard to get ground truth measurements. These measurments will be compared to the 3D 
            reconstruction of the tree to determine the reconstruction accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also designed a proxy apple tree. This tree can be easily altered to change the branch angles and locations. This allows 
            for in lab testing all year.
