        <h2>Sumobot</h2>
        <p>During my senior year at Oregon State University, I worked on my capstone project which was to create a Sumobot. The 4-person team was tasked with creating
            a robot that could fight in a mega sumobot competion. I filed the role of mechnical lead and coding lead. The design we created focused on using interesting shapes 
            and to be easily modified. The design had a metal frame with a 3D printed top and mutliple 3D printed armors. An arduino was used to control the motors and get data from
            the sensors used. The speed and direction of the motors were based off of readings from the sensors.
